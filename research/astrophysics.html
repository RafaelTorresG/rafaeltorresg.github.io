    <main>
        <p>I am deeply interested in understanding the universe at large scales, with research situated at the intersection of theoretical and observational cosmology. My work focuses on calibrating cosmological models through observations, developing methodologies to measure cosmological parameters, and proposing new models to test against empirical data. My research journey in Physics is in its early stages, I have started working in two key areas: calculating extragalactic distances beyond the reliance on Type Ia Supernovae with low uncertainty, and devising a novel method for estimating interstellar extinction. I am particularly intrigued by the Hubble Tension and the assumption of massless neutrinos in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Extending the cosmic distance ladder is central to my efforts, with the ultimate goal of refining estimates of cosmological parameters in Î›CDM models, specifically focusing on the Hubble Constant and neutrino mass. </p>

            <h3>1. Extending the Cosmic Distance Ladder</h3>
            <p>
                This project explores alternative methods to calculate extragalactic distances with low uncertainty beyond the reliance on Type Ia Supernovae. By incorporating observational data and refining calibration techniques, the goal is to improve distance measurements critical for estimating the Hubble Constant and resolving the Hubble Tension.

            <h3>2. A Novel Method for Estimating Interstellar Extinction</h3>
            <p>
                This work focuses on developing a robust methodology to estimate interstellar extinction, addressing challenges in observational cosmology where dust obscuration impacts precision measurements. The aim is to refine extinction estimates to support accurate modeling of cosmological parameters and improve data reliability.

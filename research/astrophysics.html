            <p>I am deeply interested in understanding the universe at large scales, with research situated at the intersection of theoretical and observational cosmology. My work focuses on calibrating cosmological models through observations, developing methodologies to measure cosmological parameters, and proposing new models to test against empirical data. My research journey in Physics is in its early stages, I have started working in two key areas: calculating extragalactic distances beyond the reliance on Type Ia Supernovae with low uncertainty, and devising a novel method for estimating interstellar extinction. I am particularly intrigued by the Hubble Tension and the assumption of massless neutrinos in the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Extending the cosmic distance ladder is central to my efforts, with the ultimate goal of refining estimates of cosmological parameters in Î›CDM models, specifically focusing on the Hubble Constant and neutrino mass. </p>

            <h3>On the Hubble Tension</h3>
            <p>
                My research on the Hubble Tension is divided in 3 parts: developing and improving a method (the Hubble Chains method) to determine extragalactic distances with low uncertainty and beyond the scope of current standard candles such as Type Ia Supernovae; calculating distances to quasars with z>0.1; and estimate cosmological parameters using these distances by fitting various models such as those in the families of Cold Dark Matter and Modified Newtonian Dynamics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Originally, the Hubble Chain Method assumed the universe is locally flat and recursively built the distance to high-redshift objects using bodies with known redshift and distance. The order of uncertainty will vary with how flexible the local geometry of the universe is modeled. For instance, these approximations use the Hubble-Lemaitre Law, Special Relativity, or an FLRW Cosmology.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, for example, when using the Hubble-Lemaitre Law, I can get an estimate the Hubble Constant; if we use a FLWR Cosmology, we could estimate its free parameters.

            <h3>An Statistical Approach for Estimating Interstellar Extinction</h3>
            <p>
                This work focuses on developing a robust methodology to estimate interstellar extinction, addressing challenges in observational cosmology where dust obscuration impacts precision measurements. Within our galaxy, interstellar reddening can induce relevant bias distance and brightness measurements. Moreover, extinction depends on the direction of observation, because dust abundance is inhomogeneous. This project consists on developing an statistical procedure to estimate interstellar reddening, and produce a color correction map of the Milky Way. The main challenge arises from obtaining independently measurements of distance and brightness of sources scattered across the galaxy (for example, obtaining distances from parallax and brightness from pulsation periods of Cepheid variable stars). With sufficient data, we can estimate reddening in every direction by estimating ordinary least squares models with direction fixed-effects.

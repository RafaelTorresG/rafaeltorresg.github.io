    <p>My research interests lie in the intersection between Economic History, Political Economy, and Econometrics. I have worked on the dynamics and long-run consequences of war between states and the historical roots of modern economic development, institutions, and technological progress. In particular, I have studied the Mongol Empire as an explanation for the rise of Western Europe and the decline and stagnation of China and the Islamic World.</p> 
    <p>Most recently, I have delved into spatial causal inference methodologies and data sources for historical research. My research in global economic history has driven me to need spatial analysis tools, and I find myself working on fixing and generalizing Geographic Regression Discontinuity Designs. Furthermore, during my time under the supervision of Prof. Leander Heldring, I have developed a huge interest in using LLMs, computer vision, and Machine Learning to exploit novel data sources.</p>
